## The Mobilization
This chapter is not a forecast of what *might* happen. It is a **mobilization schedule** for what *must* happen.
We are mapping out the "Solution Wavefront": the specific sequence in which different fields of science and industry will be solved. Understanding this order is critical because it dictates investment and strategy. You cannot build the roof before you pour the foundation. We map what gets solved when, why the order matters, and the critical infrastructure we must build first to make it possible.
### The "Messy Middle": Infrastructure is Destiny
Before we can "solve the world," we must build the **Industrial Base**. Just as you cannot run high-speed trains on dirt roads, the wavefront of AI progress will stall without the right foundational infrastructure. This "Messy Middle" period consists of building three specific pillars.
**1. The Scoring Systems (The Targeting Authorities)**
First, we must build the scoreboards. We call these Targeting Authorities. These are standing public leaderboards for critical domains like health, climate, and safety.
**The Mechanism:** To work, these systems must use **"blinded clears."** This is similar to a standardized test where the student (the AI) has never seen the questions before. This prevents "cheating" (memorizing the answers) and ensures the model actually understands the problem.
**The Audit:** These scores must be paired with **Decision Records for AI Systems (DR-AIS)**: permanent, unchangeable logs that show exactly how the AI made its decisions.
**2. The Plumbing (Data and Action)**
Second, we must build the pipes that move information and decisions.
**Data Trusts:** Most of the world's useful data is messy and locked inside institutions. A Data Trust is a legal and technical pipeline that converts this messy data into "reusable capital": clean, organized information that can be legally used to train models.
**Action Surfaces:** Intelligence is useless if it cannot act. We must build the APIs (software connections), robotic controllers, and contract protocols that allow AI agents to safely affect the real world. This is the "handshake" between the digital brain and the physical hand.
**3. The Energy (Energy-to-Compute Capacity)**
Finally, we must secure the fuel. We need a massive build-out of Energy-to-Compute (E2C) capacity.
**The Strategy:** In this new era, we stop treating data centers like office buildings and start treating them like aluminum smelters: heavy industrial facilities that must be co-located with clean power. We will place massive computing clusters directly next to solar farms or nuclear plants to run "schedulable" training jobs (work that can wait for the sun to shine). The strategic allocation of computing power becomes the primary driver of human progress.
In parallel we will begin to build and deploy massive orbital data centers constellations, the beginning of a Dyson Swarm, absorbing energy from our Sun 24x7, converting it into compute, and encircling our planet and our star in an ever-growing cloud of intelligence.
Alpha for Operators
**Automate evaluation before you automate the work.** If you try to build an AI agent and *then* figure out how to test it, you will lose. If you build the "harness" (the rigorous test) first and then fit the agent to it, you will win. Treat computing power as your working capital and meticulously track your **RoCS (Return on Cognitive Spend)**: are you getting smarter for every dollar of electricity you burn?
### The Wavefront at a Glance
The mobilization of these technologies will not happen all at once. It follows a logical sequence, a "Solution Wavefront" that moves from the digital realm to the physical world, and finally to the massive systems that sustain humanity and our planet.
**Phase 1 (2026-2027): The Era of Pure Information.** The first wave conquers the digital realm. Mathematics is effectively solved; metrics on the hardest benchmarks, such as FrontierMath Tier 4, have shown a vertical rate of improvement, jumping from 13% to 19% in mere months. This progress implies we are approaching a saturation point where AI can verify formal logic better than any human. Following closely is Computer Science. We are entering a period where models routinely write, debug, and verify complex code with superhuman speed and accuracy. Finally, much of Physics will likely be solved in the next couple of years, as the tools of math and code allow us to mature a simulation stack that spans everything from sub-atomic quantum particles to astrophysical galaxies.
**Phase 2 (2028-2031): The Era of the Physical World.** Once we can perfectly simulate the laws of physics, we can master matter itself. This phase is defined by the solution of Chemistry and Materials Science. We will see "Closed-Loop Labs" running 24/7, where the only metric that matters is **Time-to-Property**: how fast we can go from a digital idea to a physical sample. This paves the way for the solution of Biology in the later half of this phase, right on schedule as predicted by Ray Kurzweil. We are currently waiting for the **"Virtual Cell"** to trigger the final collapse of this domain. Once we have a high-fidelity simulation of a cell, an organ, and eventually an entire organism, biology effectively transitions into a software problem. The ultimate result is our full understanding, and the subsequent curing, of all disease. Beyond curing disease we will also learn why humans age, how to slow, stop and eventually reverse the process.
**Phase 3 (2032-2035): The Era of Planetary Systems.** With mastery over materials and biology, we can finally tackle the massive, chaotic systems that support human civilization. This is the era of Energy and Infrastructure. We will deploy Fusion, Fission, and Geothermal energy at scale, integrated with a massive, robotically deployed solar fabric spanning hundreds of kilometers. Buffered by grid-scale storage, this infrastructure makes intermittent renewables indistinguishable from baseload power. Simultaneously, the electrical grid will be transformed from a dumb copper network into a software problem, orchestrated by "schedulable compute" that balances supply and demand in real time. Finally, we will expand our systems beyond the surface of Earth, into orbit, the Moon, Mars and asteroid belt.
### Domain Deep Dives
We now examine exactly what "solved" looks like in the seven critical domains that define our future.
#### 1) Mathematics & Software: The Foundation
The first domain to fall is the one that builds all others. As noted, Mathematics and Computer Science are effectively solved. However, "solved" in this context means something specific: the transition from probabilistic guessing to formal verification.
In the past, we had "copilots" that might write code with bugs. In the solved state, specifications become **executable contracts**. This means a human engineer writes down exactly what the software must do (the contract), and the AI agent writes the code *and* mathematically proves that the code satisfies the contract. We move to "Agentic Toolchains" that produce formally verified software by default.
The benchmarks for this industrialization will be uncompromising. We will track the **Spec-to-Artifact Score**, which measures the percentage of software modules that provably meet their specification on the first try. We will measure **Proof Robustness** by subjecting code to "adversarial perturbations": deliberate attacks designed to break the logic without changing the input. In a solved world, the **Defect Rate** in safety-critical software repositories must asymptote near zero.
Alpha for CTOs
You must migrate your high-risk subsystems, like payment processing or security protocols, to verified stacks immediately. Stop paying for developer hours; begin paying for **"proofs cleared."** For all safety-critical builds, establish a **"Two-Stack Rule"**: no system goes live until two independent AI toolchains agree on its correctness.
#### 2) Physics & Cosmology: The Laws of Reality
With the tools of formal proof in hand, we turn to the laws of the universe. A "solved" physics domain is defined by an industrial simulation stack that spans all scales, from the quantum to the astrophysical, all with traceable error bars.
The way science is done will fundamentally change. Competing theories, such as String Theory versus Loop Quantum Gravity, will no longer be debated in academic papers. Instead, they will be compared by their **Predictive Loss** on shared data corpora. We will feed the theories raw data from telescopes and particle accelerators and see which one predicts the next observation with the least error. Instrument pipelines will stream directly into these models, with AI agents automatically generating new experiment designs optimized against budget and time constraints.
We will measure success by **Predictive Cross-Validation**, which is the model's accuracy on data it has never seen before (like a withheld portion of the sky). We will also track a **Unification Score**, rewarding models that can explain multiple phenomena (like gravity and electromagnetism) with a single, simple theory.
**Guardrail:** We must publish **Decision Records for AI Systems (DR-AIS)** for all analysis pipelines. Furthermore, we require independent **"Replication Packs"**: downloadable files that allow any third party to re-run the analysis and verify the result, ensuring science remains open and reproducible.
#### 3) Chemistry & Materials Science: The Digital Alchemy
From the abstract laws of physics, we move to physical matter. Solving chemistry means achieving **"Inverse Design."** In the old world, we mixed chemicals and measured their properties. In the solved world, we tell the computer the property we want (e.g., "a battery electrolyte that does not catch fire"), and the AI calculates the molecular structure that achieves it.
Dark laboratories will close the "design-make-test" loop, turning discovery from a years-long academic quest into a daily industrial operation. We will see commodity materials libraries for specific properties, like ion conductivity or fracture toughness, baked directly into the robotic rigs. The defining benchmark is **Time-to-Property ( TtP )**: the number of hours it takes to go from a target vector (the wish list) to a validated physical sample.
The obvious risk here is dual-use chemistries: tools that can design cures can also design toxins. This necessitates strict gating of export-controlled pathways, using on-device safety models and continuous compliance streams to flag dangerous requests.
Alpha for Industrial Labs
Stop funding individual research projects. Instead, fund **Action Networks**. Create shared robotic capacity with outcome-based Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Buy "dollars per verified property point" and escrow your computing power against public Time-to-Property targets.
#### 4) Biology & Medicine: From Sick Care to Health Maintenance
The "solved" state for biology is a world where care shifts from episodic (fixing you when you break) to continuous maintenance (keeping you from breaking). Biology is waiting for the **Virtual Cell** to trigger the final collapse. Once we have a high-fidelity simulation of a cell, an organ, and an organism, biology effectively becomes software. We can "debug" a disease in a computer before we ever touch a patient.
The vision is a radical departure from traditional "sick care." Traditional hospitals respond to patients after disease onset. The new system uses fully predictive models to detect disease at inception, or better yet, predict oncoming disease and enable prevention. Capital and data will shift toward **Healthspan Extension**, supporting discoveries of why humans age, how to slow, stop and eventually reverse the process allowing us to reach "longevity escape velocity," where science adds more than one year of life for every year that passes.
The benchmarks will be life-changing. We will track **Time-to-Therapy (TTT)**, measured in days from diagnosis to personalized intervention. We will measure **Outcome Uplift**, the reduction in mortality and morbidity, tracked with strict fairness bands to ensure all demographics benefit equally. And we will track **Biofab SLAs**: guarantees on the delivery times and rejection rates for manufactured organs and tissues.
Alpha for Health Systems
Convert procurement to outcomes, starting now. Stop paying for procedures and start paying for **"risk-adjusted readmissions avoided"** and **"length-of-stay reductions."** Your most urgent task is to establish the clinical action APIs and shared data registries that make this possible.
Alpha for Consumer-Health
Stop paying for health services delivered after you are sick, and start paying for “days of continuous and optimized health.”
#### 5) Engineering & Manufacturing: The Speed of Information
Solving manufacturing means compressing the physical supply chain to the speed of information. The "solved" state is **Design-to-Part-to-Verification in under 24 hours (D2P24).**
Imagine sending a digital file to a factory. A "lights-out" microfactory (a facility with no humans inside) receives the file, produces the part, verifies its quality, and ships it. Digital twins that are perfect virtual copies of the factory and product will be the non-negotiable source of truth. Compliance becomes a live data stream proving quality in real-time, not a PDF report filed weeks later.
**Key Benchmarks:**
**D2P24:** The percentage of products delivered within 24 hours of specification with first-pass yield.
**Zero-Defect Corridor:** A guarantee that defects will remain below a certain parts-per-million (ppm) count, bounded with real-time root-cause proofs.
**Sustainability Ledger:** Attested kilowatt-hours per kilogram and embodied carbon per unit.
#### 6) Planetary-Scale Challenges: Industrializing Stability
In the domains of Energy, Climate, Food, and Water, "solved" means the industrialization of stability.
The electrical grid will cease to be a dumb copper network and will become a software problem. **"Schedulable Compute"** (data centers) will act as a primary demand-response asset. This means data centers can ramp their power usage up when the sun is shining and wind is blowing, and ramp it down instantly when supply is low. They act like a giant virtual battery, stabilizing the grid.
Clean baseload power will grow via next-generation fusion, fission, and flexible renewables, accelerated by solar transitioning into “infrastructure-as-code.” Autonomous swarms will deploy gigawatts of capacity per month at a marginal cost approaching the price of raw glass and silicon. When paired with high-density chemical storage, this creates ubiquitous terrestrial 24/7 electricity. **Direct Air Capture (DAC)** will reach price transparency, becoming a true commodity where we pay for carbon removal by the ton. Food production and water purification systems will close their loops, integrating synthetic proteins, precision fermentation, and vertical farms to create a system where waste becomes nutrients for the next cycle.
**Key Benchmarks:**
**The Energy-to-Compute (E2C) Index:** Useful cognitive work per kilowatt-hour by region.
**Reliability SLAs:** Minutes of power outages avoided per year.
**The CO₂e Ledger:** Dollars per ton of carbon (equivalent) durably removed, verified by third parties.
Alpha for Policymakers
**Procure outcomes, not projects.** Stop funding proposals and start paying for "reliability minutes avoided," "tons of CO₂ removed," or "verified learning-gains" in schools. Escrow your budget against verified clears on public targets.
#### 7) Humanities & Social Domains: Augmentation and Justice
In pluralistic domains like Education, Law, and Governance, "solved" does not mean we have found a single final answer. It means we have industrialized the tools for augmentation and justice.
In **Education**, this means the digitization, demonetization, and democratization of learning. Every child on Earth will have access to the best education delivered by personalized agents over 5G/6G networks on their smartphones and glasses. In **Law and Governance**, it looks like "Policy Sandboxes": simulation environments that run automatic impact tests before a law is passed, much like testing software before release. We will have "Continuous Compliance" systems that check if regulations are being followed in real-time, and citizens will have the power to audit these systems via open Decision Records.
### The Playbook to Make the Wavefront Real
This future is not inevitable; it must be built. The operational playbook below is straightforward, imperative, and actionable.
**1. Publish Targeting Systems, Then Budgets:** We must stop writing vague checks. Tie all funding to **"Blinded Clears"** on public targets. This means the model is tested on data it has never seen before, preventing cheating. Attach "Red-Team Bounties" to reward those who find safety flaws.
**2. Stand Up Action Networks:** Intelligence needs hands. Fund shared robotic labs, microfactories, and clinical devices with open scheduling and outcome-based Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This gives AI agents the ability to affect the physical world safely.
**3. Compute Escrow:** Money talks, but compute acts. Pre-commit training and inference credits that are unlocked only when a team hits a specific benchmark gain. This aligns incentives perfectly with progress.
**4. Outcome Procurement That Only Funds Results:** Stop funding slide decks. Write contracts that pay *only* for verified results. If the pothole isn't fixed, or the patient isn't cured, the payment doesn't release.
**5. Instrument for Trust:** To ensure these systems remain safe, trust must be engineered rather than assumed. We accomplish this by mandating **Decision Records for AI Systems (DR-AIS)**, which act like a "black box" flight recorder for algorithms, creating a permanent, unchangeable forensic log of exactly *why* an AI made a specific high-stakes choice. Crucially, these logs must be wired directly to **Programmatic Down-Shifting**, an automatic safety brake similar to the mechanical governor on an elevator. If the live data shows that an AI's safety, bias, or reliability scores have dropped below a set threshold, the system doesn't wait for human permission to act; the code automatically throttles the AI back to a safer operating mode or halts it entirely, preventing harm the instant a regression is detected.
Alpha for Investors & Philanthropists
**Own the rails.** The "application layer" (the specific app or model) is a trap; it will be commoditized and value will drop to zero. The durable value is in the infrastructure of the solved world: the targeting platforms, the audit harnesses, the data trusts, the action networks, and the compute escrow services. These are the railways of the abundance economy.
