## The Quiet Hum
When the rails are finally in place, progress undergoes a phase shift. It "snaps" from rhetoric to routine. We stop seeing AI and abundance as miracles, and we start treating them like utilities: boring, reliable, and omnipresent, just like electricity or running water.
This is the "snap" that signals a domain has been solved. But our work does not end there; it compounds. In this new world, the scarce resource is no longer intelligence, energy, or capital. The scarce resource becomes **Aiming**. Our collective challenge shifts to choosing purposes that are worthy of this new power and holding ourselves accountable to the safety floors that keep that abundance humane.
This essay was not a forecast of what *might* happen. It was a field manual for industrializing discovery and execution. The rails are the factory. The AI is the power. The targets are the product.
We will measure our era not by the wonders we promised, but by the solutions we delivered safely, fairly, and for everyone.
Build the rails. Aim the charge.
