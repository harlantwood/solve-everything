Chapter 2: The Thesis

The era of Artificial Superintelligence has effectively begun. The most critical question facing us is no longer if superintelligence can be created, but rather who aims this powerful weapon, and at what.

When we deliberately route large-scale intelligence toward "Positive-Sum Moonshots," ambitious projects that benefit everyone rather than just creating winners and losers, and measure our progress against rigorous, tested standards, we achieve two specific outcomes:

Entire domains are solved in bulk. We stop trying to solve one problem at a time, like discovering a single new drug, and instead build industrial systems that solve the entire field, like building a platform that can cure any pathogen on demand.

Problems become "Compute-Bound." A domain is considered "solved" when we no longer need a stroke of human genius to fix a problem. Instead, we can solve it simply by applying enough computing power and data.

Defining Our Terms: The Scale of the Force

To understand where we are going, we must clarify what we are building. We are not talking about significantly better chatbots.

AGI, Artificial General Intelligence: This is the milestone where an AI system is as capable as a median human expert across all economically valuable tasks. If you can hire a human to do it, an AGI can do it, too. We anticipate this will be common and accessible in 2026.

ASI, Artificial Superintelligence: This is the moment AI exceeds human capability not just by a small margin, but by orders of magnitude. By 2035, we are speaking about systems trained on ten to the twenty-ninth power FLOPs of compute. To put that number in perspective, such a system has ingested and synthesized more information than all human beings who have ever lived, combined. This is no longer a tool; it is a force of nature.

Three Foundational Claims

Our thesis rests on three claims. These explain how we move from today's world to a future of abundance.

Claim 1: Cognition is a Commodity.

The old "Input-Based" economy, where you get paid for the hours you work, is dead.

For the last twenty years, intelligence was like an artisanal craft: it required scarce researchers and custom-built data systems. However, between 2026 and 2030, three trends are converging to destroy that old model.

Model Quality is rocketing past human limits. We are moving from "smart software" to a surplus of super-human intelligence that can handle messy, real-world tasks.

The Unit Cost of Cognition is collapsing. The cost to make a decision, or verify a mathematical proof, is dropping toward its physical limit: the price of the electricity required to flip the switches in a computer chip.

The Friction of Integration is falling to zero. This means AI is moving out of the browser and into the real world. It is shifting from a chatbot writing a poem to an autonomous agent executing a binding legal contract or controlling the temperature in a fusion reactor. Beyond this, AI is moving into the physical world with autonomous drones, robotaxis, and humanoid robots.

Once super-human thought becomes cheap and accessible, like a utility bill you pay as you go, we can "pour" computing power onto a problem the same way we pour concrete to build a foundation. The bottleneck is no longer human brainpower. The new bottleneck is routing: deciding where to point this firehose of intelligence.

Claim 2: Targeting Systems Industrialize Progress.

Artisans rely on personal taste. Industries rely on Targeting Systems, formerly known as "benchmarks." A field allows for industrial-scale progress only when we can state, with mathematical precision, "This number is what success looks like."

In Biomedicine: Success isn't "we tried hard." It is measured in Time-to-Drug-Approval, hours not years, and minimized side effects.

In Education: It is measured in Learning Gain per Hour. As an example: If a student uses an AI tutor for one hour, do they retain the skill 180 days later? That is a measurable metric.

Targeting systems don't just record history; they create the future. When you measure something and offer a reward for it, capital and research flood into that area. The moment a government says, "We have placed one billion dollars in an escrow account. It will be released to the first system that beats Target X," a flywheel of progress ignites. Prices fall, capabilities rise, and the public sector starts buying actual outcomes rather than just reading proposals.

Claim 3: The "Shaped-Charge" Model.

Much of today's AI research focuses on constraining what systems are allowed to do. Our thesis adds a focus on where those systems should be aimed.

Think of ASI as raw explosive energy. A shaped charge is an explosive designed to focus all its energy into a tiny point to penetrate armor. We must focus ASI by routing it through Moonshots. These are massive missions validated by strict, adversarially-tested targets. A project qualifies as a Moonshot if it is:

Positive-Sum: It increases the size of the pie for everyone, for example creating unlimited organs for transplant, rather than fighting over a fixed pie, such as deciding who gets the one available kidney.

Auditable: Performance is verified by independent, automated tests.

Composable: The pieces used to build the solution are open and verified, allowing others to build on top of them like LEGO bricks.

When intelligence flows through these specific channels, safety improves organically because every step is measured against guardrails.

The Enemy: "The Muddle"

The obstacle to this future is not technology. It is "The Muddle."

The Muddle is the entrenched layer of bureaucracy, pricing based on "inputs" like hours worked, and scarcity-minded institutions that currently run the world. The Muddle thrives on friction and inefficiency. We are in a race: The Rails, our new efficient systems, versus The Muddle. If we build the targeting systems fast enough, we win. If The Muddle throttles the ASI with red tape, we lose the century.

What We Mean by "Solved"

We use the word "solved" in a very specific, game-theoretic way.

The Theoretical Definition: A domain is solved when the main bottleneck shifts from human genius to available computing power. It means we know how to solve the problem; we just need to spend the energy to do it.

The Operational Definition: A domain is solved when tasks can be automated to beat human experts reliably, with transparent failure modes.

Solved Math: You input a conjecture, and a swarm of AI agents generates a formal proof within hours.

Solved Physics: An AI identifies a gap in experimental data, proposes a new theory, and designs the collider experiment to test it.

Solved Biology: A patient has a new virus. The system sequences it, designs a protein to bind to it, and outputs a recipe for the cure in 24 hours.

An Operational Playbook for the War on Scarcity

To win, we must mobilize:

Fire the "Press Release" Department. Stop announcing intentions. Publish the Targeting System. Convene experts to define three to seven core metrics that capture public value.

Build the Test Harness First. Turn your goals into code. Build data pipelines that include "adversarial cases," difficult scenarios designed to trick the AI, from day one.

Treat Compute as Ammo. Forecast your "compute cash flow." Know exactly how much processing power you need to achieve your targets.

Route for Impact. Aim at the Moonshots. Insist on open datasets and protocols so that we create a wider defensive perimeter against misuse.

Trust but Verify. Publish Decision Records. These are auditable logs showing exactly who changed what, when, and why. Pre-commit to "kill switches": if safety scores drop by a certain percentage, the system automatically slows down.

This is not a map of a future that will happen automatically. It is a call to build it. Abundance is not about a world of luxury; it is about a world of possibilities. It is about having more ways to learn, heal, and build per unit of energy.

Choose your Moonshot. The rest of this essay shows you how to aim the charge.
