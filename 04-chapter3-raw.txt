## The Mechanics
**Thesis:** When we say a problem is "solved," we mean it has become **compute-bound**.
This is a critical shift. We are moving from the realm of *genius* (waiting for a brilliant insight) to the realm of *logistics* (organizing resources). A domain is "solved" when we can get a predictable result just by pouring more computing power into the system. What was once a craft accessible only to a world-class expert becomes a system accessible to anyone.
To map the future, we must define the destination. "Solved" is not a vague hope; it is an engineering reality with a specific anatomy, a predictable maturation curve, and a set of unmistakable signatures that signal its arrival. The concept of a “solved” domain is the fundamental unit of progress in the age of AGI.
### The Industrial Intelligence Stack
A domain, whether it is accounting, dermatology, or structural engineering. cannot be industrialized until its foundations are solid. We call these layers the **Industrial Intelligence Stack**. If a layer is missing, the system will fail.
Think of early aviation. We couldn't "industrialize" air travel until we first understood the physics of lift and drag. We had to make the physics legible before we could make the flight safe.
Here are the layers required to turn a craft into an industry:
**Purpose and Payoff (The Goal):** The bottom layer. We must move beyond vague mission statements like "improve health" to quantifiable metrics, such as "reduce sepsis rates by 50%."
**Task Taxonomy (The Map):** We break the complex job down into tiny, measurable actions. It is the assembly line instruction manual for cognitive work.
**Observability (The Eyes):** You cannot fix what you cannot see. This layer consists of sensors, logs, and data streams that act as the system's nervous system.
**The Targeting System (The Harness):** This is the engine of the stack. It is a collection of difficult tests that an AI model must pass. It acts as quality control, actively trying to break new models to ensure they work.
**The Model Layer (The Brain):** This is the AI agent itself, the software making the decisions, trained against the Harness.
**Actuation (The Hands):** Decisions are useless unless they affect the world. This layer allows the AI to act: via a robotic arm, an API that sends an email, or a smart contract that releases funds.
**Verification and Red Teaming (The Immune System):** Continuous, independent attacks on the system to find flaws before they cause damage.
**Governance and Incentives (The Rules):** We realign the money. Instead of paying for "hours worked," we switch to "pay-for-performance" contracts.
**Distribution and Maintenance (The Scale):** Ensuring the system works as a reliable utility, like the power grid, rather than a one-off science project.
### The Maturation Curve: From L0 to L5
As we pour intelligence, data, and capital into any specific field, whether it is customer service, radiology, or software coding, it does not just get "better" randomly. It evolves through five predictable stages of maturity.
This progression is not a matter of opinion; it is a ladder that every industry climbs.
#### L0: The Ill-Posed Domain ("The Muddle")
**The State of Ambiguity:** At this stage, we don't even agree on the rules of the game. The objectives are contested, the data is messy or non-existent, and decisions are driven by anecdote, charisma, or "gut feeling" rather than evidence. There is no standard way to do the work, so every success feels like a lucky accident.
**The Human Role:** Humans do everything, relying on intuition and politics.
**The AI Role:** Non-existent. AI cannot learn because there is no clear target to aim at.
**Real-World Example:** **Corporate Strategy.** In most boardrooms, decisions are made based on who makes the most persuasive PowerPoint presentation, not on rigorous data. One executive thinks "success" is market share; another thinks it is profit margin. It is a Muddle.
#### L1: The Measurable Domain
**The Era of Scoreboards:** This is the first step toward sanity. We may not know *how* to solve the problem perfectly yet, but we have agreed on *what* we are measuring. We start instrumenting the process and creating basic leaderboards. We can finally see who is winning, even if we don't fully understand why they are winning.
**The Human Role:** Humans still do the work, but they are now being graded.
**The AI Role:** The AI acts as a referee or scorekeeper, collecting data and showing us the baseline performance.
**Real-World Example:** **Sales Call Tracking.** We start recording calls and measuring "conversion rates." We don't have an AI that can sell the product yet, but we know exactly which human salespeople are closing deals and which aren't.
#### L2: The Repeatable Domain
**The Era of Playbooks:** Because we can measure success (L1), the best human performers start to identify patterns. They write down what works. We develop "Standard Operating Procedures" (SOPs) and checklists. The process is still manual, but it is now consistent. We have reduced the variance; the outcome is no longer a roll of the dice.
**The Human Role:** Humans follow a strict script or checklist.
**The AI Role:** AI begins to assist by offering templates or auto-completing simple steps, acting like a smart spell-checker for the domain.
**Real-World Example:** **Commercial Flight.** Pilots follow rigorous pre-flight checklists. They don't just "wing it." The process is highly standardized, making safety predictable.
#### L3: The Automated Domain
**The Tipping Point:** This is the critical inflection point. The checklists from L2 become code. AI agents begin executing the majority of the primitive tasks. The "grunt work" is handed over to the machine. Humans move "up the stack," shifting their focus from doing the work to supervising the agents and handling weird, edge-case exceptions that the AI hasn't seen before.
**The Human Role:** The human becomes a manager and exception-handler, stepping in only when the AI gets confused.
**The AI Role:** The AI is the primary worker for 80% of the volume.
**Real-World Example:** **Modern Call Centers.** You talk to a chatbot or voice-AI first. It solves the easy problems (resetting a password, checking a balance). If your problem is complex, it routes you to a human.
#### L4: The Industrialized Domain
**The Economic Flip:** The market fundamentally changes here. Buyers stop hiring humans to do the task entirely. Instead, they buy "verified outcomes" from a system. The unit economics of the AI system permanently beat human-only methods. It is no longer cheaper or sensible to hire a person to do this job from scratch. The industry has been standardized.
**The Human Role:** Humans act as auditors and system architects, ensuring the machine is running safely.
**The AI Role:** AI runs the show, delivering high-quality work at a speed and cost humans cannot match.
**Real-World Example:** **Factory Assembly Lines.** We don't hire artisans to hand-build cars anymore. We have industrialized the process with robotics. We buy the outcome (a working car), not the hours of hammering metal.
#### L5: The Commoditized Domain ("Solved")
**The Compute-Bound State:** The problem is solved. It has moved from the realm of genius to the realm of simple logistics. If you want more output, you just plug in more servers (compute). Multiple providers can solve the problem perfectly, so they compete purely on price. The service becomes as boring and reliable as tap water.
**The Human Role:** The consumer. We simply use the output without thinking about how it was made.
**The AI Role:** The invisible utility running in the background.
**Real-World Example:** **Gene Sequencing.** Twenty years ago, sequencing a human genome was a billion-dollar "Moonshot" requiring the world's best scientists. Today, it is an L5 service. You can mail a saliva kit to a lab, and machines do it for $100. It is fast, cheap, standardized, and requires zero human genius to execute.
### The Great Conversions: The Signatures of Victory
How do you know when a domain has tipped from a craft (L2) to a solved industry (L5)? Look for these seven specific changes in how the world works.
**From Effort to Outcomes:** The economy changes. We stop paying for labor hours or software licenses. We pay for results. *Example:* Instead of paying a pest control company for a monthly visit (effort), you pay a subscription that is free if you see a single bug (outcome).
**From Documents to Data:** We stop relying on PDF reports and audits. We switch to "machine-verifiable proofs": live data streams that prove safety guardrails are holding in real-time.
**From Projects to Pipelines:** Product development ceases to be a discrete event (e.g., "releasing a drug in 2030"). It becomes a continuous pipeline where AI is constantly simulating and submitting new candidates to the FDA harness.
**From Heroics to Harnesses:** Prestige shifts. We stop celebrating the brilliant individual who fixes a crisis at 2 AM. We celebrate the team that built the test harness so robust that the crisis never happened.
**From Secrecy to Shaped Openness:** Companies open-source their safety components to build ecosystem resilience, while competing on user experience.
**From Averages to Tails:** An average reliability of 99.9% is not good enough if the 0.1% failure is a plane crash. We stop optimizing for the average day and start optimizing for the worst-case scenario (the "tail risk").
**From Talent to Compute Liquidity:** In a solved domain, the strategy is no longer hoarding experts. The strategy is deciding where to allocate your computing power. Capital is measured in FLOPs (Floating Point Operations).
**From Applied Problems to Grand Domains**
The framework we have described, turning a craft into an industrial process, is fractalline. This means the exact same rules apply regardless of the size of the problem. The steps you take to industrialize a small process, like diagnosing a skin rash, are the same steps you take to industrialize a massive challenge, like curing cancer or solving energy.
Solving a narrow, foundational problem is the prerequisite for solving a broad, complex one. This creates a **Domino Effect** of discovery. When you solve the bottom layer, the layer above it suddenly becomes easier.
Consider this specific progression of how we get to infinite clean energy (Fusion):
**1. The Foundation: Solved Math** Everything starts here. Mathematics is the language of the universe, but verifying complex proofs is currently slow and prone to human error.
**The Shift:** We build AI systems that can instantly verify formal mathematical proofs with zero error.
**The Result:** Math becomes a reliable, automated utility. We no longer need to trust a human mathematician's intuition; we have a "spell-checker" for the fundamental logic of reality.
**2. Unlocks: Solved Physics** Because we have "Solved Math," we can now model the physical world with perfect precision.
**The Shift:** We don't have to wait for an Einstein to have a sudden epiphany. AI agents can use the tools of Solved Math to propose unified theories and run billions of simulations to see which ones match reality.
**The Result:** We understand the laws of the universe, from how atoms bond to how gravity waves move, at a resolution humans could never achieve alone.
**3. Unlocks: Solved Materials Science** Because we have "Solved Physics," we know exactly how atoms behave under any condition. This allows us to become "digital alchemists."
**The Shift:** We stop discovering new materials by trial-and-error in a wet lab (mixing chemicals and hoping they don't explode). Instead, we simulate new materials at the atomic level on a computer.
**The Result:** We can design a material with the exact properties we need, like a metal that doesn't melt at 3,000 degrees or a superconductor that works at room temperature, before we ever mine the ore. Crucially, this allows us to unlock the 'Forever Battery'—energy storage densities that utilize common earth elements like sodium or sulfur, eliminating supply chain bottlenecks and allowing us to bank solar energy for weeks at a time.
**4. Unlocks: Solved Fusion** This is the ultimate prize. We have known the theory of fusion energy for decades, but we couldn't build the machines because our materials weren't good enough (the magnets would melt or the containment would fail).
**The Shift:** With "Solved Materials" (specifically, those better superconductors we just designed), we can finally build the hardware capable of containing a fusion reaction.
**The Result:** Commercially viable, infinite clean energy. We didn't solve fusion by attacking fusion directly; we solved it by solving the three layers beneath it.
### The Quiet Hum of a Solved World
When this chain reaction takes hold, the macroeconomy transforms. We will see a structural decline in volatility, with fewer energy crises and fewer supply chain shocks, and a dramatic acceleration in discovery.
Crucially, the public will experience this not as a series of shocking, disjointed miracles, but as the **quiet, reliable hum of a solved world.** Just as you don't marvel at the "miracle" of electricity every time you flip a light switch, you will not marvel at the miracle of AI curing a disease or balancing the power grid. It will simply work, reliably and cheaply, in the background.
